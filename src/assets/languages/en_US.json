Upon acceptance of this Distributor Agreement by Unicity International, Inc. (\"Unicity\"), I will\nbe an independent contractor and licensed distributor (hereinafter \"Distributor\") of Unicity,\nwhich gives me the right to sell Unicity products (the \"Products\") in accordance with the\nUnicity Compensation Plan (the \"Compensation Plan\"). This Distributor Agreement will be\ndeemed accepted by Unicity in its sole discretion when it is entered into the Unicity database,\nso long as there have been no violations with respect to this application and the Policies and\nProcedures. Distributor Agreements submitted by telephone will be temporarily accepted;\nhowever, the original Distributor Agreement or a facsimile thereof must be received by\nUnicity within thirty (30) days for it to be considered for acceptance. Distributor Agreements\nappropriately entered online will be considered for acceptance. The acceptance by Unicity of\nthis Distributor Agreement may be rescinded if it has been determined there has been any\nmisrepresentation or violation of the Distributor Agreement.\n\n3. I have read the Compensation Plan as well as the Policies and Procedures for Unicity\nindependent Distributors (the \"Policies &amp; Procedures\"). I agree to be bound to and abide\nby the terms and conditions of each of these documents, and the terms and conditions of\nthe Compensation Plan and the Policies &amp; Procedures, including revisions, supplements,\nand amendments thereto, and further agree they are incorporated herein by this reference.\nThis is an integrated Contract (the \"Contract\") that also includes the Compensation Plan\nand the Policies &amp; Procedures. Other than these referenced documents, no other promises,\nrepresentations, guarantees, or agreements of any kind shall be valid unless in writing\nand signed by an authorized offi cer of Unicity and me. I acknowledge that any violation of\nthe Contract or any other agreements or obligations I may have with Unicity or any of its\naffi liated entities may result in the termination of my Distributorship or other disciplinary\naction, as deemed appropriate by Unicity, in its sole and absolute discretion. In the event of\nany inconsistency between the Policies &amp; Procedures, any amendment hereto, and any other\npublication of Unicity, including the Compensation Plan, the current Policies &amp; Procedures\nshall govern.\n\n4. I understand that no product purchases are necessary to become a Distributor and the only\npayment required to become a Distributor is the Franchise License fee referenced on the front\nof the Distributor Agreement form and which authorizes me act as a Distributor under the\nContract and to receive all of the benefi ts of such Distributorship.\n\n5. Automatic Refi ll Agreement. If I elect to participate in the Automatic Refi ll program, by\nentering into an Automatic Refi ll Agreement, I authorize Unicity to ship my order to me no\nlater than the 20th of each month, after processing the payment method that I have indicated.\nUnicity is under no obligation to ship any products until full payment has been received.\nShipment will take place approximately two days from payment confi rmation. Any new\nAutomatic Refi ll Agreement received will cause an order to be shipped within two days of\nreceipt of said agreement. Each month thereafter, my Automatic Refi ll order will be sent. Each\nAutomatic Refi ll order will be shipped within three to fi ve days after the date of receipt or as\nspecifi ed in the order. Shipping and handling charges will be applied to each Automatic Refi ll\norder.\n\n    a. Automatic Refi ll. This program allows me to automatically receive my product order\n    each month and guarantees that, as a Distributor in good standing, I will meet the PV\n    qualifi cation requirement to be eligible for Awards under the Compensation Plan in\n    that month, if my Automatic Refi ll order is for at least the minimum qualifying amount\n    required by the Compensation Plan.\n\n    b. Revision. I may revise my Automatic Refi ll Agreement according to the Policies &amp;\n    Procedures.\n\n    c. Cancellation. I may not cancel my Automatic Refi ll Agreement for the fi rst 90-days\n    after it becomes effective. Thereafter, I may cancel my Automatic Refi ll Agreement by\n    submitting a new Automatic Refi ll Agreement with \"Stop Automatic Refi ll\" written at the\n    top. The Customer Service Department must receive the cancellation notice no later than\n    10 business days prior to my next Automatic Refi ll shipment date. If the cancellation is\n    received less than 10 business days prior to shipment, there will be no guarantee that\n    the last order will not ship. I will not be allowed to return any Automatic Refi ll orders\n    to Unicity if I remain a Distributor, unless I can provide evidence to show that the\n    cancellation had been received more than 10 business days before the order as shipped,\n    such as a fax transmittal sheet.\n\n    d. 70% Rule. When placing any product order, I certify I have sold or consumed a minimum\n    of seventy percent (70%) of all previous orders (the \"70% Rule\").\n\n6. This Distributor Agreement shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of acceptance and\nis subject to a required annual renewal. Unicity is not obligated to renew this Distributor\nAgreement. I acknowledge that this Distributor Agreement and the Distributorship created\nhereunder may be terminated by Unicity if the Distributor Agreement is not renewed for any\nreason. The Distributorship created hereunder is a licensed right that is revocable, and the\nposition this Distributorship creates in the Unicity Distributor Organization and/or database is\nthe property of Unicity.\n\n7. If I wish to terminate this Distributor Agreement, I will deliver to Unicity written notifi cation of\nmy intent to terminate. My voluntary termination will be effective as of the date such notice is\nreceived and accepted by Unicity.\n\n8. As a Distributor, I am an independent contractor. I am not an employee, partner, agent,\njoint venturer, or legal representative of Unicity. I agree that I am solely responsible for my\ncompliance with any and all laws or regulations related to my business in any jurisdiction\nexercising authority over me, including but not limited to the duty to license my business\nand to collect and pay sales or use tax on sales and on products I consume (unless Unicity\notherwise agrees to collect and remit such taxes). I will obey any and all federal or local laws,\nstatutes, and regulations applicable to my business and me.\n\n9. Although Unicity or any of its affi liated entities may assist me in becoming aware of applicable\nlaws, rules, and requirements, the sole responsibility to lawfully conduct my independent\nUnicity business in any jurisdiction rests with me. Therefore, I release Unicity and any of its\naffi liated entities and their offi cers, agents, and employees from all liability for any of my\nactions or omissions. I also waive any claims or causes of action which I (or others acting in\nmy interest) may have occasion to assert respecting my status or conduct as an independent\nDistributor or Sponsor of Unicity arising out of any of my acts or omissions. I agree to\nindemnify and hold harmless Unicity, its offi cers, employees, successors, Distributors, and\nany of its affi liated organizations for any claim, action, or liability asserted arising out of\nmy actions, omissions, admissions, or representations in sponsoring or conducting my\nindependent Unicity business.\n\n10. This Distributor Agreement allows me to recruit prospective Distributors of Unicity in the\nUnited States and its possessions and territories. I may only sponsor Distributors in other\ncountries pursuant to the conditions of the Unicity Ambassador Program, which is included in\nthe Policies &amp; Procedures.\n\n11. I understand that only Distributors in good standing (as such status is determined by Unicity)\nmay Sponsor new Distributors. Unicity, at its sole discretion, may reject this Distributor\nAgreement without disclosing any reason therefore. If this Distributor Agreement or any\nrenewal hereof is not accepted or approved, I release Unicity and its offi cers, agents, affi liates,\nadvisors, and employees from any and all liability, claims, damages, or cause of action.\n\n12. I understand that I am responsible for training and supporting any Distributors I Sponsor and/\nor recruit under the Compensation Plan. I will perform a best effort bona fi de supervisory,\nsoliciting, distributing, and/or selling function in connection with the sale of Unicity products\nto the ultimate consumer. I also agree to train any Distributor whom I may Sponsor or recruit\nin the performance of these functions. I will maintain continuing communication with and\nsupervision over my Unicity Distributor organization.\n\n13. I understand and agree that any Awards I receive from Unicity are granted under the rules of\nthe Compensation Plan or the rules of a Unicity program as may be established from time to\ntime.\n\n14. I agree that I may not alter, repackage, relabel, or otherwise change any Unicity product, nor\nwill I sell any such product under any name or label other than that authorized by Unicity.\nI further agree that I will refrain from producing, selling, and using any compensation plan,\nprogram, writing, recording, or any other materials that have not been previously approved\nor provided by Unicity.\n\n15. I understand and agree that I may not convey, assign, or otherwise transfer any rights arising\nhereunder without the prior written consent of Unicity. Unicity may assign the Contract\nwithout my consent.\n\n16. I agree not to use proprietary trade names, trademarks, or other property of Unicity without\nthe prior written consent of Unicity.\n\n17. I will make no claims of therapeutic or curative properties regarding Unicity products or\nclaims involving the Compensation Plan that are not contained in offi cial Unicity literature that\nis produced and distributed by Unicity.\n\n18. Unicity and its affi liated entities have proprietary rights to its Distributors and lists of Distributor\nnames. I will not use any Unicity Distributor Lists or other Unicity contacts to promote the sale\nor use of any products, programs, or services other than those offered through Unicity, to any\nUnicity Distributor whom I do not personally Sponsor. I further agree that I may not hold a\nbenefi cial interest in more than one Unicity Distributorship except as expressly allowed in the\nCompensation Plan. I will return all existing Distributor Lists upon request by Unicity or upon\nmy termination.\n\n19. In the event I choose to purchase Unicity Products on my credit card or banking debit card,\nmy signature on this Distributor Agreement hereby constitutes my authorization to process\nany order I place to those accounts and to use this as my \"signature on file.\"\n\n20. If any provision of this Contract is found to be unenforceable or invalid, the validity of the\nremaining provisions shall not be affected.\n\n21.
